# [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

In 2019, I managed to solve 13 days of puzzles (27 stars in total). For this year's challenge, my aim is to surpass last year's result. I am using Python as the main language for all the puzzles. Wish me luck!
